background on this woman...

167
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,538
...all the way
back to the 20s,

168
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,457
when she was working
as an actress.

169
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,626
An actress. There's your
first clue, Sherlock.

170
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,212
Her name was
Rose Dawson back then.

171
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,256
Then she marries
this guy named Calvert.

172

They move to Cedar Rapids and she
punches out a couple of kids.

BROCK: Louis XVI wore
a fabulous stone that was...

201
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:31,189
...called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

202
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:34,151
...which disappeared
in 1792...

203

...about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

204
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:42,159

diamond was chopped, too.

A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

And it was filed right
after the sinking.

224
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,630
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

241
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:44,573
She kind of bumps along...

242
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:45,907
...punching holes like
morse code...

243

-- dit-dit-d it --

...below the water line.

245
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:52,289
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

246
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,665
Now, as the water
level rises...

247
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,667
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

...which, unfortunately, don't
go any higher than E deck.

249
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,380

250
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,133
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

255
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,644
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

256
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,438
So, what happens?

257
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,607
(CLICKING TONGUE) She splits,
right down to the keel.

258

259
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,151
...falls back level.

260

Then...

261
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,320
...as the bow sinks...

262
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,322
...it pulls the
stern vertical...

263

...and then finally detaches.

264

of jewelry she owned...

...just waiting for
her long, lost love.

805

to your final crossing...

York on Tuesday night...

After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

...then I went to
Los Angeles to the...

portraits for 10 cents each.

Forgive me.

01:16:34,849 --> 01:16:36,267

Rose, you miss nothing,

...the deck would look
too cluttered.

So, I was overruled.

it is on an unsinkable ship.

Where are the passengers?

1589
01:50:02,897 --> 01:50:06,234
They went inside.
Too cold and noisy for them.

1590
01:50:06,484 --> 01:50:10,822
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1591
01:50:17,703 --> 01:50:19,372
(CHATTER)

1592
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:26,838
Care for a drink, sir?

1593
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,300
Sonny, what's doing?

1594
01:50:31,384 --> 01:50:34,262
You get us all trussed up and
now we're cooling our heels.

1595
01:50:34,512 --> 01:50:37,014
Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go find out.

1596
01:50:37,682 --> 01:50:40,017
Nobody knows
what's going on.

1597
01:50:40,268 --> 01:50:43,187
Just like the damn English--
everything by the book.

1598
01:50:43,437 --> 01:50:46,190
No need for language,
Mr. Hockley.

1599
01:50:46,357 --> 01:50:48,734
Go back and turn on
the heaters in our rooms.

1600
01:50:48,776 --> 01:50:51,195
I want a cup of tea
when I return.

1601
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:03,040
Mr. Andrews.

1602
01:51:05,042 --> 01:51:08,379
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1603
01:51:08,713 --> 01:51:10,381
Please tell me the truth.

1604
01:51:18,556 --> 01:51:20,391
The ship will sink.

1605
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:23,144
You're certain?

1606
01:51:24,228 --> 01:51:29,066
In an hour or so, all this will
be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1607
01:51:31,736 --> 01:51:33,779
Please, tell only
who you must.

1608
01:51:33,863 --> 01:51:36,073
I don't want
to cause a panic.

1609
01:51:36,407 --> 01:51:39,243
And get to a boat.
Quickly. Don't wait.

1610
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:43,080
You remember what
I told you about the boats?

1611
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:46,751
Yes.

1612
01:51:48,586 --> 01:51:50,087
I understand.

1613
01:51:58,095 --> 01:51:59,430
Over here, son.

1614
01:52:00,431 --> 01:52:03,601
Sir, there's a big mob at the
Second Class Purser's office.

1615
01:52:03,935 --> 01:52:05,686
Go on. I'll watch him.

1616
01:52:06,437 --> 01:52:08,439
Aye. Right.

1617
01:52:22,119 --> 01:52:27,124
Sir, Carpathia says they're making
17 knots. Full steam for them, sir.

1618
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,378
She's the only
one responding?

1619
01:52:30,628 --> 01:52:34,215
The only one close.
They'll be here in four hours.

1623
01:52:58,656 --> 01:53:00,658
We are swung out
and ready, sir.

1624
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:06,080
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats?

1625
01:53:07,999 --> 01:53:09,000
(QUIETLY) Yes.

1626
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:16,340
Women and children first, yes.

1627
01:53:17,842 --> 01:53:19,176
Yes, sir.

For the time being, I require
only women and children.

Put your lifebelts on.
Lifebelt on.

1638

your lifebelts on.

1642

Let women and children
through to the front.

What are we doing?

1644
01:54:21,155 --> 01:54:24,241
Waiting. Once first-class
people are in the boats...

1645
01:54:24,492 --> 01:54:27,828
...they'll start with us
and we want to be ready.

you out any faster.

1647

Go get help.

1648

(SNIFFS)

2562
03:02:47,757 --> 03:02:49,259
I'm sorry.

2563
03:02:51,928 --> 03:02:53,430
Three years...

2564
03:02:54,097 --> 03:02:56,766
...I've thought of
nothing except Titanic.

2565
03:02:57,601 --> 03:02:59,436
But I never got it.

2566
03:03:02,564 --> 03:03:04,441
I never let it in.

2567
03:04:37,325 --> 03:04:38,451
Ha!

2568
03:07:39,174 --> 03:07:43,344
(SINGING)
<i>Every night</i> in <i>my</i> dreams

2569
03:07:43,386 --> 03:07:48,725
<i>I see you, I feel you</i>

2570
03:07:48,808 --> 03:07:55,190
<i>That is how I know you go on</i>

2571
03:07:58,526 --> 03:08:02,906
<i>Far across the distance</i>

2572
03:08:02,989 --> 03:08:08,161
<i>And spaces between us</i>

2573
03:08:08,203 --> 03:08:14,584
<i>You have come to
show you go on</i>

2574
03:08:17,837 --> 03:08:22,091
<i>Near, far</i>

2575
03:08:22,175 --> 03:08:26,387
<i>Wherever you are</i>

2576
03:08:26,471 --> 03:08:29,724
<i>I believe that</i>

2577
03:08:29,808 --> 03:08:36,105
<i>The heart does go on</i>

2578
03:08:37,398 --> 03:08:41,528
<i>Once more</i>

2579
03:08:41,569 --> 03:08:45,865
<i>You open the door</i>

2580
03:08:45,907 --> 03:08:51,079
<i>And you're here in my heart</i>

2581
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:58,002
<i>And my heart will go on and on</i>

2582
03:08:59,128 --> 03:09:03,424
<i>Love can touch us one time</i>

2583
03:09:03,466 --> 03:09:08,805
<i>And last for a lifetime</i>

2584
03:09:08,888 --> 03:09:15,562
<i>And never let go
till we're gone</i>

2585
03:09:18,523 --> 03:09:22,777
<i>Love was when I loved you</i>

2586
03:09:22,819 --> 03:09:28,241
<i>One true time I hold to</i>

2587
03:09:28,283 --> 03:09:34,956
<i>In my life we'll always go on</i>

2588
03:09:37,834 --> 03:09:42,130
<i>Near, far</i>

2589
03:09:42,171 --> 03:09:46,426
<i>Wherever you are</i>

2590
03:09:46,467 --> 03:09:49,762
<i>I believe that</i>

2591
03:09:49,804 --> 03:09:56,144
<i>The heart does go on</i>

2592
03:09:57,395 --> 03:10:01,524
<i>Once more</i>

2593
03:10:01,608 --> 03:10:05,862
<i>You open the door</i>

2594
03:10:05,945 --> 03:10:11,075
<i>And you're here in my heart</i>

2595
03:10:11,159 --> 03:10:17,999
<i>And my heart will go on and on</i>

<i>You're here</i>

2597
03:10:40,730 --> 03:10:44,984
<i>There's nothing I fear</i>

2598
03:10:45,026 --> 03:10:47,445
<i>And I know</i>

2599
03:10:47,528 --> 03:10:54,077
<i>That my heart will go on</i>

2600
03:10:56,204 --> 03:11:00,375
<i>We'll stay</i>

2601
03:11:00,458 --> 03:11:04,879
<i>Forever this way</i>

2602
03:11:04,963 --> 03:11:09,300
You are safe in <i>my</i> heart

2603
03:11:09,384 --> 03:11:14,889
<i>And my heart will go on</i>

2604
03:11:14,973 --> 03:11:19,560
<i>And on</i>
