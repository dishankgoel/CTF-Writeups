StuffIt (tm) for Linux and Solaris installation

This document gives general installation instructions for installing the StuffIt
(stuff and unstuff) utilities on Linux and Solaris.

When you install utilities from the tarball(s), you have a choice of where to
install the files, however you may need to take care of the PATH environment
variable if you install in a location other than those recommended below.

The following files are contained in the tarball:

stuff
    ./bin/register
    ./bin/stuff
    ./doc/stuff/INSTALL
    ./doc/stuff/LICENSE
    ./doc/stuff/README
    ./doc/stuff/stuff.html
    ./man/man1/stuff.1

unstuff
    ./bin/unstuff
    ./doc/unstuff/INSTALL
    ./doc/unstuff/LICENSE
    ./doc/unstuff/README
    ./doc/unstuff/unstuff.html
    ./man/man1/unstuff.1

We recommend installing these files in /usr/ or /usr/local/. (You may have to login
as root.) Change to the directory where you want to install the files.
    cd <install directory>

To install stuff and unstuff utilities from the tarballs:
    gunzip <tarball.tar.gz>
    tar -xvf <tarball.tar>
    rm -f tarball.tar

If your version of tar supports a -z option, you can decompress gzip and untar in
one operation, without an intermediate file:
    tar -xzvf <tarball.tar.gz>



Setting up the user environment

To use the stuff and unstuff utilities, make sure that the user environment is
set up correctly. The following environment variable should be set:

PATH:
    Should contain the location where the programs stuff and unstuff are in the
    file system. In the recommended installation the /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/
    directory should already be included.
