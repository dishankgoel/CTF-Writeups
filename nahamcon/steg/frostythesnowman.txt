Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul	      	      	     	   
With a corncob pipe and a button nose     	       	       		   
And two eyes made out of coal       	      	  		      	    
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say  	      	  	       
He was made of snow but the children know	   	  	       	  
How he came to life one day	 		 	   		    
There must have been some magic in	   	     	   	     	  
That old silk hat they found		    	       		       	  
For when they placed it on his head  	  	  		  	       
He began to dance around   	  	 	 	      	       	    
Oh, Frosty the snowman   	     	  	  	   	  	    
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
